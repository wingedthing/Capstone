This folder holds the legacy code produced during the initial testing and development phase of our Capstone project.  

The code here represents our attempts to understand the MetaWear sensor APIs, DYNAMIXEL actuator APIs, and how to use the data produced to track an asset in the Cartesian plane.  

This legacy code is kept solely as a failsafe backup for testing purposes while our full application is built. This legacy code will be removed from this repo once that application is finished.  

The final iteration of the code in the legacy folder is represented by the scripts in the Message_Broker and track_and_plot folders.  
Those scripts can be used to produce test data.
